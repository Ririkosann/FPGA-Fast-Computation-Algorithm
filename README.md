 In order to implement advanced cryptography, the following algorithms can be implemented
In order to implement advanced cryptography, the following algorithms can be implemented.

①Simple implementation

②Karatsuba operation

③Schoenherr-Straussen

 
# DEMO
 
 For example
 Load the ssa files into Vivado
 133×255　＝　22915
 Introducing values in the testbench
 
 In the vivado simulator, you can do the following calculation.

# Usage
 
If you do not have Vivado installed, install Vivado, download the file and load it.

If you don't have a testbench file, create one by assigning values to it.


 
# Note
 
Since the performance of the FPGA is moderate, the SSA will be implemented only in the simulator.
